# Additional-Projects

While my GitHub lists some of the projects that I have worked on, I do have other additional projects outside of my public GitHub. There are often different reasons as to why they have not been displayed on my public GitHub, licensing, university policy, etc. However, please feel free to contact me and I would be happy to showcase any additional projects.

I am also between changing server hosts, so a lot of my hosted projects, such as my personal website, are not currently available. Again, a demo can be showcased upon request.
